/* CSS Flex
In this section, we will be converting the work from the previous section from using floats to using flexbox.

First, let's remove the clearfix class from our header as it won't play well with flex.
Next, we should unfloat our logo image and our nav, and remove the inline-block display property from the list items in our nav.
Now that we've undone our beautiful styling, we can call flex to our aid! Let's add display: flex to our header and see what happens.
Our logo and nav links should be side-by-side now since they're both children of our header. Now figure out which element needs display: flex for our individual nav links to appear side-by-side.
The last thing we need is more space between our logo and our nav links. Give our header justify-content: space-between so that it arranges its children just the way we want. */
